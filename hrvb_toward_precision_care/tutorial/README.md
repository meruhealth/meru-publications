These documents come from a presentation on this material at a leading data science conference, entitled ODSC West in 2022.

This tutorial walks the user through most of the main concepts and data science analyses needed to understand the results in our subsequent publication in the journal Psychophysiology. We provide example code in python; however, it may be worth mentioning that the ultimate real-time algorithm upon which the results were based was run using a complex mix of languages, including python as well as javascript, sql, and others. This may conceivably affect the results.
